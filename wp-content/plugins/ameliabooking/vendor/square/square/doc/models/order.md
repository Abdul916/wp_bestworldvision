# Order

Contains all information related to a single order to process with Square,
including line items that specify the products to purchase. `Order` objects also
include information about any associated tenders, refunds, and returns.

All Connect V2 Transactions have all been converted to Orders including all associated
itemization data.

| `locationId` | `string` | Required | The ID of the seller location that this order is associated with.<br>**Constraints**: *Minimum Length*: `1` | getLocationId(): string | setLocationId(string locationId): void |
| `referenceId` | `?string` | Optional | A client-specified ID to associate an entity in another system<br>with this order.<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `40` | getReferenceId(): ?string | setReferenceId(?string referenceId): void |

| `customerId` | `?string` | Optional | The ID of the [customer](../../doc/models/customer.md) associated with the order.<br><br>__IMPORTANT:__ You should specify a `customer_id` if you want the corresponding payment transactions<br>to be explicitly linked to the customer in the Seller Dashboard. If this field is omitted, the<br>`customer_id` assigned to any underlying `Payment` objects is ignored and might result in the<br>creation of new [instant profiles](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/customers-api/what-it-does#instant-profiles).<br>**Constraints**: *Maximum Length*: `191` | getCustomerId(): ?string | setCustomerId(?string customerId): void |

For taxes with `LINE_ITEM` scope, an<br>`OrderLineItemAppliedTax` must be added to each line item that the tax applies to. For taxes<br>with `ORDER` scope, the server generates an `OrderLineItemAppliedTax` for every line item.<br><br>On reads, each tax in the list includes the total amount of that tax applied to the order.<br><br>__IMPORTANT__: If `LINE_ITEM` scope is set on any taxes in this field, using the deprecated<br>`line_items.taxes` field results in an error. Use `line_items.applied_taxes`<br>instead. | getTaxes(): ?array | setTaxes(?array taxes): void |
| `discounts` | [`?(OrderLineItemDiscount[])`](../../doc/models/order-line-item-discount.md) | Optional | The list of all discounts associated with the order.<br><br>Discounts can be scoped to either `ORDER` or `LINE_ITEM`.

Use `line_items.applied_discounts`<br>instead. | getDiscounts(): ?array | setDiscounts(?array discounts): void |

| `metadata` | `?array<string,string>` | Optional | Application-defined data attached to this order.
