Download and display your Airbnb business reviews in your Posts, Pages, and Widget areas with a review slider!

== Description ==

Now you can easily display your Airbnb reviews on your WordPress site in a cool slider or grid! Take our word for it, testimonials work a lot better when your customers can verify they came from Airbnb directly.

I created this plugin to easily fetch your Airbnb reviews and then display them on your WordPress site. It's simple and easy to use. Here's a video of setting up Airbnb reviews on your site in less than 2 minutes!
